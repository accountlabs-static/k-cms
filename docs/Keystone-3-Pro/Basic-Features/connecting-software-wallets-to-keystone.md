## FAQ: {#ee9b58ff9f414bbdb352ed8991db365c}


<details>
  <summary>Can I import my seed phrases generated by software wallets, like MetaMask, into Keystone?</summary>


Yes, technically, you can import seed phrases from software wallets into Keystone. **However, it's essential to prioritize security.** We strongly advise generating your seed phrase offline, as Keystone does. Seed phrases generated by software wallets are created while connected to the internet, which exposes them to potential risks. Even if you import such seed phrases into a hardware wallet like Keystone, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated.
