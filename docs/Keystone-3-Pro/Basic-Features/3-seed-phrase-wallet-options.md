# Create or Import with 3 Seed Phrases {#7f81f3d3124e4b4f89ea9e0ca8c38df3}


Keystone 3 Pro is a device that helps you manage 3 sets of seed phrases at once. This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding, generating, and managing these wallets, ensuring the security of your funds.


## Before You Start {#8ca756244ca647f9bf0a4f2f5fba2b72}


**Your seed phrase is the key to your funds.** Regard it as your most valuable possession, and handle it with utmost care to protect your assets.

1. **Keep Your Seed Phrase Secure:** 
Keep your seed phrase safe where no one else can get to it. Write it down on the Seed Phrase Sheet that comes with your product, and put it in a safe place. You can also use the [Keystone Tablet](https://keyst.one/shop/products/keystone-tablet-plus) which is even tougher and keeps it safe from things like fire and rust.
1. **Create Your Seed Phrase Offline:** 
It's safer to generate your seed phrase without an internet connection. This makes it harder for hackers to compromise your information. When you create your seed phrase using Keystone, it's completely offline. Also, avoid importing an online seed phrase into Keystone, as this can still expose you to online risks.
1. **Keystone Hardware Wallet Approach:** 
For maximum security, only create your seed phrase using a Keystone hardware wallet. Refrain from importing an online seed phrase into a hardware wallet, as this could jeopardize your security. Instead, you can link Keystone with compatible third-party software wallets to access various features in a secure manner, like sending, minting NFT, staking, and so on.
1. **Think Carefully, Sign Confidently:** 
Keystone offers a unique feature that decodes transaction details before you sign them. This way, you're fully aware of what you're approving. This helps you dodge potential phishing attacks. For instance, hackers might mimic your desired receiving address, but Keystone's feature reveals the true transaction details.
