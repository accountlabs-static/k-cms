## **A Must-Read Guide for Keystone Users: Ensuring Security Before You Explore** {#1175773f0b6141afa6c64de1e3b338da}


If you're new to hardware wallets and have been using software wallets, you might have heard about seed phrases and their importance. Seed phrases give you control over your digital assets. With them, you can receive and send coins securely. However, it's crucial to be aware of certain important things to protect your assets.


<details>
  <summary>Keep Your Seed Phrase Secure</summary>


Keep your seed phrase safe where no one else can get to it. Write it down on the Seed Phrase Sheet that comes with your product, and put it in a safe place. You can also use the [Keystone Tablet](https://keyst.one/shop/products/keystone-tablet-plus) which is even tougher and keeps it safe from things like fire and rust.



  </details>


<details>
  <summary>Create Your Seed Phrase Offline</summary>


It's safer to generate your seed phrase without an internet connection. This makes it harder for hackers to compromise your information. When you create your seed phrase using Keystone, it's completely offline. Also, avoid importing an online seed phrase into Keystone, as this can still expose you to online risks.



  </details>


<details>
  <summary>Keystone Hardware Wallet Approach</summary>


For maximum security, only create your seed phrase using a Keystone hardware wallet. Refrain from importing an online seed phrase into a hardware wallet, as this could jeopardize your security. Instead, you can link Keystone with compatible third-party software wallets to access various features in a secure manner, like sending, minting NFT, staking, and so on.



  </details>


<details>
  <summary>Think Carefully, Sign Confidently</summary>


Keystone offers a unique feature that decodes transaction details before you sign them. This way, you're fully aware of what you're approving. This helps you dodge potential phishing attacks. For instance, hackers might mimic your desired receiving address, but Keystone's feature reveals the true transaction details.



  </details>


Remember, your seed phrase is the foundation of your crypto security. Handle it with the utmost care and make the most of the advanced security features Keystone offers.
