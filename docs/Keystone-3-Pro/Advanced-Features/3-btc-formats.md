# Which BTC address should I use as there are 3 kinds of BTC? {#c2b969afe7a74ead87d9d90ae73131bc}


If you're using Bitcoin (BTC), you might have noticed that there are three different address formats available: Native SegWit, Nested SegWit, and Legacy. Each of these formats has its own characteristics and advantages. In this tutorial, we'll explore the differences between these address types and guide you on how to choose and use the right one for your needs.


## **Why Are There Three Types of BTC Addresses?** {#e358c34f6d7b444fa64248a02200420c}


Bitcoin has evolved over time, and with that evolution, new technologies have been introduced to improve transaction efficiency, reduce fees, and enhance security. As a result, three different address formats have emerged: Native SegWit, Nested SegWit, and Legacy.


## **Characteristics of the Three BTC Address Formats** {#2d9268db32f847d3a0e797d61914f52f}

1. **Legacy (P2PKH/P2SH):**
  1. Format: Addresses start with '1'.
  2. Characteristics: These are the original Bitcoin addresses and are fully functional. However, they tend to have larger transaction sizes and higher fees compared to newer formats.
  3. Recommended Usage: If you're interacting with older wallets or services that don't support SegWit, you might use Legacy addresses.
1. **Nested SegWit (P2SH-P2WPKH):**
  1. Format: Addresses start with '3'.
  2. Characteristics: These addresses provide a compromise between compatibility with legacy systems and improved transaction efficiency. They have smaller transaction sizes and slightly lower fees than Legacy addresses.
  3. Recommended Usage: If you need compatibility with older wallets or services but still want some of the benefits of SegWit, you can use Nested SegWit addresses.
1. **Native SegWit (P2WPKH):**
  1. Format: Addresses start with 'bc1'.
  2. Characteristics: These addresses offer the highest transaction efficiency, resulting in the smallest transaction sizes and lowest fees. They also have improved security features compared to the other formats.
  3. Recommended Usage: If you want to take full advantage of the latest Bitcoin technology, use Native SegWit addresses whenever possible.
