# **How to Connect Keystone with Rabby Wallet** {#9590e3cb9a884f90bb804f03318fc624}


Rabby Wallet is an EVM-compatible extension especially designed for Keystone Essential or Pro hardware wallets. With Rabby, you can securely manage your ETH, ERC-20, and other assets with ease and convenience.


Benefits of using Rabby with Keystone:

1. **Multiple Sets of Mnemonic Phrases:** Unlike some other wallets like MetaMask, Rabby can connect with multiple sets of seed phrases while still being connected with Keystone. This gives you more flexibility in managing different wallets and assets.
1. **Switch Between Supported Networks:** Rabby allows you to switch between different networks like Arbitrum and Polygon, providing you access to various EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystems.
1. **Connect with Other Software Wallets:** You can also connect Rabby with other software wallets, such as MetaMask, enabling a seamless and interconnected experience.

With Keystone connected, you can enjoy these features while having the peace of mind that your seed phrase and private keys remain securely stored in the hardware wallet's secure element, offering enhanced security.
