# **Special Discounts for Gen2 Users** {#5bd26eab235947068971756bd4d37e2e}


Dear Valued Keystone users,

First and foremost, we want to express our deep gratitude for your unwavering support and love in Keystone. Your commitment has fueled our journey since the inception of our Keystone Gen2 in 2021.

Over the years, we've embraced progress and development by taking substantial leaps, such as open-source our firmware and code. These efforts culminated in the launch of two distinct versions: one tailored for BTC enthusiasts and another catering to those seeking multi-coin functionality.

As time has unfolded, we've recognized the need to evolve further to meet your ever-changing requirements. With profound respect for your security needs, we've decided to transition to an even more advanced embedded system. This strategic shift allows us to fortify our security by reducing potential points of vulnerability. Our dedication to your safety is further evident through the integration of three Secure Elements and PCI-level hardware designs, taking our security standards to new heights.

To express our appreciation, we are thrilled to introduce a special offer exclusively for all Keystone Gen2 owners like you:

 **If you made your purchase before May 31, 2023, you're entitled to a generous 40% discount as a token of gratitude for your early adoption. 
For those who acquired their Keystones on or after June 1, 2023, we are pleased to offer an even more enticing 50% discount.**

If you're considering upgrading to Gen3, we kindly ask you to reach out to us via email at "[**support@keyst.one**](mailto:support@keyst.one)." 
Please include the following details for verification:


  1. **Comprehensive details of your purchase, including your order number.**
  2. **The unique serial number of your Keystone: You can locate this by tapping the menu button on your Keystone, then selecting [About Keystone], where the Serial Number will be listed below.**
  3. **The email address used for placing your order (using the same email when contacting us is preferable).**
  *Please note that this discount has no expiration date.

It's important to note that your Gen2 device remains fully operational. We will keep maintenance on Gen2 mainly to keep it secure and fluent for your normal usage.


Moreover, if the Gen2 adequately serves your needs, there's no pressure to upgradeâ€”it's entirely up to you.


Plus we have exciting news for those eagerly anticipating the BTC version:

**The Keystone team is diligently working on a new device tailored specifically for the Bitcoin version. This new device is projected to be launched in time for the upcoming halving anniversary and will incorporate features like Taproot and BIP85.**



Should you have any inquiries or require assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us - support@keyst.one. 


Your unwavering support has been the cornerstone of our journey, and we are genuinely grateful for your love. Together, we are propelling the Keystone legacy forward.



With heartfelt appreciation,
Keystone team
